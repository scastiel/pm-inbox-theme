Inbox ProtonMail theme
======================

A light and clear theme for ProtonMail, inspired by Google Inbox, with several color styles.

To install it, copy the whole CSS in *dist/pm-inbox-xxxxx-theme.css* (replace xxxxx with the style you choose, see below), open your ProtonMail account settings, select the *Appearance* tab, and paste the CSS into the *Custom theme* field.

This is based on [Austin Delamar's work](https://github.com/amdelamar/pm-theme).
